Converts a pick and place file generated by Altium Designer to one accepted by a NeoDen/Dengxin Tech TM240 or TM220.

Uses a file called feeders.json to store config data for the feeders. Feeders can be set up from within the program. Currently you must manually edit this file to edit or remove feeders.

A copy feeders.json is included in this repo for students at MTU. If you're not a student at MTU you can delete it or remove it from the directory of AltiumToTM240A.py and a new feeders.json will be created

Feeder names are taken from the "Comment" column in the pnp file from altium, so make sure your components have comments that are descriptive of the component type.

To export ensure your first eight columns are, in order: Designator, Comment, Layer, Footprint, Center-X(mm), Center-Y(mm), Rotation, Height(mm)
Also be sure to check Metric and CSV
