Converts a pick and place file generated by Altium Designer to one accepted by a NeoDen/Dengxin Tech TM240 or TM220.

Uses a file called feeders.json to store config data for the feeders. Feeders can be set up from within the program. Currently you must manually edit this file to edit or remove feeders.
An example of feeders.json is included in this repo. Delete it or remove it from the directory of AltiumToTM240A.py if you don't want to use it.
